// CWK-075 — POINTER gate. Ship-text names something that cannot be reached.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT CWK-060's GATE. That one resolves KEYS against config-schema.mjs.
// These are POINTERS — to a file, a directory, a section, a symbol — and nothing
// resolved them. Same family, different resolver: the key gate asks "is this name in
// the schema", this one asks "is the thing this name points at REACHABLE FROM A CLONE".
//
// THE CHAIR'S RULING THIS ENFORCES (settled; this module does not re-decide it):
// a probe cited as proof is not a throwaway. Cite the DURABLE artefact — a commit SHA,
// a reviewer return, a lab record — and recycle the probe; if the probe file is the only
// evidence, it has stopped being a throwaway, so commit it or restate the claim. A
// GITIGNORED PATH IS NOT A DURABLE CITATION. The gate enforces that distinction. It does
// NOT ban citations, and the shape of that restraint is the whole detection rule below.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ READ THIS BEFORE ANY NUMBER BELOW — WHOSE MEASUREMENT IS WHOSE.
//
// This module is a PORT of CoalMine's, and its header arrived carrying CoalMine's own
// measurements written in the first person ("MEASURED on this repo"). INSPECT found the
// class three times and then found four more instances; patching them figure by figure
// was whack-a-mole, and each patched number would go stale again on its next edit. So
// the layer is ATTRIBUTED once, here, instead:
//
//   EVERY FIGURE BELOW IS COALMINE'S unless a block says OURS. They are retained
//   deliberately, as the REASONING THAT PRODUCED THE RULE -- which step removed which
//   class of false positive, and why each was chosen -- never as a claim about this
//   tree. That reasoning is why the rule has the shape it has, and deleting it would
//   leave a set of unexplained filters.
//
//   COALLEDGER'S OWN MEASUREMENTS, the only first-person numbers in this file, are the
//   FUNNEL block below (48 surfaces / 1,327 tokens / 141 shaped / 49 in scope / 49
//   resolving) and the BACKSLASH block further down (14 backslash tokens, 2 path-shaped,
//   both this module's own fixtures). Re-derive either with the walk in verify.mjs 2.12.
//
//   THE FLOCK RULE THIS OBEYS: a source's variables are not ours. A ported number is a
//   HYPOTHESIS about a different tree until measured here -- so it is labelled, not
//   silently adopted and not silently deleted.
// ============================================================================
// DETECTION RULE — every step MEASURED before it was chosen, because cry-wolf is the failure mode this room has already
// paid for once (the tripwireMaxLines gate firing on compliant code).
//
//   The rule is TWO layers, and which layer a test belongs to is not cosmetic:
//   SHAPE tests live in pointerCandidates (text only, no tree knowledge); SCOPE tests
//   live in checkPointers (ourRoots, agentHomes, hasEntry). A shape rule that needs the
//   tree is a rule in the wrong place, and CWK-075 r2 moved one back after it silently
//   excluded four of our own tracked files.
//
//   SHAPE (pointerCandidates)                          drops
//     - whitespace                a command or a Markdown table row, not a pointer
//     - <placeholder>             the author already said "not a literal path"
//     - glob metacharacter        a glob names a SET, not a file
//     - no `/`                    a bare filename is the SCANNED user's repo's
//     - absolute / `~` / URL      not this repo's to resolve
//     - a `.` or `..` SEGMENT     navigates, does not NAME; and would escape the repo
//
//   SCOPE (checkPointers)                              decides
//     - an agent install home     the SCANNED project's tree, even where the root is ours
//     - first segment in ourRoots resolve from the repo root
//     - first segment beside the  resolve from the citing file's own directory (or its
//       citer (or its parent)     parent) -- structural, so it is never circular
//
//   MEASURED ON THIS REPO -- CoalLedger, and these are OURS, re-derived here rather
//   than carried over with the file: 48 surfaces, 1,327 backticked tokens with fenced
//   code stripped -> 141 survive the shape funnel -> 49 IN SCOPE -> 49 resolve, 0
//   non-resolving, 0.0% noise. Re-derive with the walk in verify.mjs 2.12; never quote
//   these numbers forward.
//
//   PORT NOTE (CWK-075 INSPECT MED-1): this block arrived byte-identical to CoalMine's
//   own -- 76 surfaces / 1,483 / 121 / 67 -- under the words "MEASURED on this repo",
//   with a re-derive pointer at ITS block number (2.11, ours is 2.12). A foreign
//   measurement wearing the first person is the same defect this gate's own header
//   already records twice about backticked paths, one layer deeper: the port carried a
//   CLAIM ABOUT A DIFFERENT TREE and the word "this" silently re-pointed it. The numbers
//   above are this room's, produced by the walk named above; the two sets differ in
//   every term, which is exactly why inheriting them would have been wrong rather than
//   merely stale.
//
//   THE TWO SCOPE TESTS ARE CWK-075 ROUND 2, AND BOTH CLOSED A SILENT HOLE, which is the
//   quieter failure and the one this whole class is about. Before them the gate was
//   repo-root-anchored and dropped every dot-first token, so 40 citations were checked
//   where 67 were checkable:
//     +15  citer-relative -- `references/checks.md` cited from its own skill dir was
//          never checked at all. A sibling room's gate called such a path NON-RESOLVING
//          (a loud false positive); ours dropped it from coverage without a word.
//     +16  dot-dir -- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.githooks/`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
//          are real TRACKED files of ours that the extractor discarded on sight. TWELVE
//          were in the surfaces as they stood; the other four are dot-dir citations this
//          very header adds while explaining the fix, and they are dot-dir citations like
//          any other -- an earlier wording counted them as a separate "+4 new header"
//          term, which double-counts the same tokens under two labels. 15 + 16 = 31, and
//          40 + 31 = 71, the number the pass line reports.
//   Noise stayed 0.0% across both, which is the number that had to hold.
//
// THE INSIGHT THAT MAKES THE RULE WORK, and a naive rule unusable: a shipped skill's
// prose names files in the SCANNED USER's repo — `package-lock.json`, `STANDARDS.md`,
// a bare `SKILL.md` — which by construction do not exist in ours. Those are not
// pointers into our tree at all. Steps 5-8 are four different ways of saying the same
// thing: only a path ROOTED IN OUR OWN TREE is a claim this repo can be wrong about.
//
// Steps 2, 3, 6 and 7 were NOT in the rule as first sketched, and each removed a whole
// class of false positive that a directory-component rule alone leaves standing:
//   2  shell commands and Markdown table rows are path-shaped (`node scripts/install.mjs
//      cursor`, `| package | direct/transitive | ... |`) — a SPACE is what separates a
//      command from a pointer.
//   3  `<gitroot>/.coalmine.json`, `plugin/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` are TEMPLATES; the
//      angle bracket is the author already saying "this is not a literal path".
//   6  a URL or an absolute path is not this repo's to resolve.
//   7  `.cursor/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/`, `.claude/rules/`, `.git/hooks` — a DOT-DIR
//      is an agent or tool HOME, and shipped prose names those in the USER's project.
//      This is step 8's insight one level up, and without it the residue is 15.9% noise
//      of which every single flag is wrong.
//
// NAMED BLIND SPOTS — stated as what is UNCOVERED, with its measured cost, never as a
// denial. A reader who is only told what the gate is NOT learns nothing about what is
// exposed; this room's own flock rail, applied to this gate first.
//
//   1. AN UNBACKTICKED PATH IS INVISIBLE. Extraction keys on backticks, so a path named
//      in plain prose is never a candidate — it cannot fail, and it cannot be counted in
//      the pass line either. MEASURED, fenced code stripped FIRST (a sibling room's own
//      count moved 6 -> 7 -> 2 the moment fences were stripped, so the order is part of
//      the measurement): 2 unbackticked path-shaped tokens rooted in our own tree, and
//      BOTH are grep artefacts rather than citations — "skills/_shared" is a Markdown H1
//      that happens to be a directory name, and "hooks/scripts" in README is English
//      prose meaning "hooks and scripts". They are quoted here WITHOUT backticks on
//      purpose: backticking them makes them real citations, and when this paragraph was
//      first written the gate FAILED on this very comment, naming the second token as a
//      citation that does not resolve. The documentation of a blind spot must not
//      manufacture one — twice over, since the first reword quoted the FAIL message
//      verbatim and re-introduced the backticks it was reporting. So the uncovered
//      population is 2 tokens and 0 real citations today. That is the cost, and it is
//      small because the house style already backticks paths — not because the gate
//      reaches them.
//
//   2. A SECTION AND A SYMBOL ARE NOT RESOLVED AT ALL. Not "the gate is path-only" — the
//      uncovered things are: a `file.md` §Heading whose heading has moved, and a
//      backticked identifier in a comment whose symbol has been renamed. Both were
//      measured and both flood (below); nothing checks them, and the pass line says so.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT IS NOT SHIPPED, AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT DECIDED IT. The dispatch asked for
// three resolvers — path, section, symbol. PATH is shipped. The other two were measured
// FIRST and both flood; shipping them would have been the cry-wolf gate this rule's own
// step-by-step exists to avoid.
//
//   SECTION ("the X section below", `file.md` §Heading):
//     - SELF-REFERENTIAL pointers are a population of FOUR across every .md and .mjs in
//       the tree, and all four resolve. A gate over four passing candidates buys nothing.
//     - Worse, the matcher cannot be made honest: run against CWK-059's own history
//       (`config-keys.mjs` at 04116d1 and 209689b) a "<token> ... below" rule reports
//       8 candidates and 6 DANGLING — and all six are false, because natural language
//       puts the wrong word next to "below" (`matches KEY_SHAPE below` is read as
//       "matches ... below"). 75% noise, 100% of it wrong.
//     - CROSS-FILE section refs are ~55 and the overwhelming majority target files that
//       do not exist here at all (`hooks-safety.md` §9, `skill-authoring.md` §3b live in
//       the umbrella). Resolving them is not this repo's job.
//
//   SYMBOL (a backticked identifier in our own code comments):
//     - 45 candidates, 37 resolve, 8 do not — 17.8% noise, AND ALL EIGHT FLAGS ARE
//       FALSE. Every one is a symbol named as a REJECTED ALTERNATIVE or an external
//       stdlib name the comment says we do NOT call (`renameSync`, `statSync`,
//       `appendFileSync`, `ignoreExclusions`, `disableFilters`). Discriminating "named
//       as the thing we use" from "named as the thing we rejected" is prose parsing, and
//       after such a filter the surviving population is all-resolving — a gate that
//       catches nothing.
//
//   So: partial coverage, STATED. Path is machine-checked; section and symbol are not
//   checked at all, by these numbers, and nobody should read this gate's green as
//   covering them.
//
// ============================================================================
// ADOPTER CONTRACT — DATA, never LOGIC. Six rooms reached six different verdicts on
// CWK-060's filter and this rule will fare no better, so nothing below hardcodes
// CoalMine's layout. A room supplies: its own surfaces (walked), its own ourRoots and
// ignoredRoots (derived from ITS tree), its own agentHomes (derived from whatever map
// that tool uses to write into a USER's tree — CoalMine's is its own targets map;
// THIS ROOM HAS NONE, ships no installer, and therefore derives agentHomes as the EMPTY
// SET, which is what the wiring in verify.mjs 2.12 says and why. The ported line named a
// file this room does not have, while our own wiring depended on its absence: two files
// in one unit making opposite claims about the same missing path, CWK-075 INSPECT),
// its own
// hasEntry() and resolve(), and its own pending list. Every one of those is DATA read
// out of the adopting tree; none of them is a decision this module makes for a room.

// A path this room deliberately points at BEFORE it exists. Ships EMPTY, and the empty
// list is a MEASUREMENT, not an omission: every in-scope pointer resolves (67 of 67 at
// the CWK-075 r2 re-measurement), so nothing here has needed a declaration yet.
//
// The mechanism exists anyway, and that is a decision with a reason rather than padding:
// without an escape hatch the first legitimate forward pointer hard-FAILs, and the
// cheapest way to make a FAIL go away is to delete the gate. Same EVENT-based expiry as
// PENDING_KEYS/NOT_CONFIG — a declaration is pruned by what BECOMES TRUE, never by a
// date nobody re-reads.

// shape test, took the ourRoots branch on `scripts`, and path.resolve landed OUTSIDE
// the repo (measured). That is this room's own recorded lesson -- resolve-and-contain,
// not segment-scan, because a scan misses `\` on Windows -- reappearing inside the fix
// written to close a traversal hole.
//
// REJECTION rather than a wider separator class, and the reason is the lesson itself:
// widening DOTSEG keeps the segment-scan SHAPE and patches one miss, leaving the
// invariant platform-conditional. Rejecting the character makes it unconditional --
// A CITATION IN OUR SURFACES IS `/`-DELIMITED, on every platform, full stop -- and it
// closes more than the traversal case: `scripts\lib/x.mjs` (mixed) yields a first
// segment nothing matches, so it was SILENTLY skipped rather than dangerous. Half the
// class was quiet and half was live; now the whole class is out of scope uniformly.

// room's evidence): 14 backticked tokens contain a backslash, and exactly 2 are
